# u4pak.exe
 
Pretty much u4pak made by https://github.com/panzi/u4pak 
But instead it has a Ui. 

This is very simple to use. 

Pretty much just drag your FortniteGame Folder into the directory where the TivaU4Pak.exe is.

Then launch up TivaU4Pak.exe and Set your pak name and press save. 
Then just press "Compress FortniteGame to Pak" and it will start creating your pak with the name you wanted.
